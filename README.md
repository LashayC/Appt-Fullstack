## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

For this I first focused on getting up the form and then making sure the data went up to the database like I expected it to. From there I set up ejs to render the data and added the feature of being able to favorite certain entries. 


## Lessons Learned:

With htis project I learned to target data using it's objectID in mondoDB as well as focus on signed in users to selectively render data that they see.
